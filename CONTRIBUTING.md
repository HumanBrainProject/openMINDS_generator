# How to contribute <a name="top"/>

openMINDS is by design an open-source, community-driven project incorporating input and feedback from all community members independent of their scientific background.

**Do not be shy!** We, the openMINDS development team, rely on you, as a community member, to get in touch if you have general feedback or a request for a new feature, want to report a bug or have a question. Depending on the type of message for us, you can either contact us via our support-email or via an issue on our GitHub repositories. You are also welcome to contribute to discussion in the issue tracker.

For more details please go to: [Report & ask questions](#report-questions)

**Help us directly!** Contributions from outside the openMINDS development team are always very welcome. If you spot a bug and know how to fix it, if you want to extend existing schemas and/or metadata models, or develop new schemas and/or metadata models, feel free to fork this repository and open a pull request with your changes. For larger changes, please raise an issue beforehand to get feedback from the openMINDS development team and the community.

For more details please go to: [Direct contributions](#direct-contributions)

**Be nice!** Contributing to openMINDS should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Report & ask questions <a name="report-questions"/>

In particular, general feedback and questions are welcome through our support-email: **`openminds@ebrains.eu`**

It is also possible to request new features or report bugs this way, but in these cases we prefer if you could raise an issue on the respective GitHub repository (see below).

If you write us an email, please make sure that you provide a meaningful subject that describes your concern. If your concern is not of general nature, please name the affected GitHub repository and file in your email. In particular for bug reports, provide us with a screen shot or copy of your error message (where applicable). 

You can also report and ask questions through the issue tracker of our GitHub repository. If your concern is of general nature, please consider raising an issue on the  [central openMINDS repository](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS). In contrast, bug reports and feature requests are better raised as issue on the affected openMINDS repository.

If you raise an issue, please make sure that you provide a short meaningful title and a more detailed description that declares your concern. In particular for bug reports, provide us with a screen shot or copy of your error message (where applicable).

## Direct contributions <a name="direct-contributions"/>

If you want to contribute to the openMINDS_generator directly, feel free to fork it and open pull requests with your changes. Note, that larger changes and new features should be first raised and discussed as an issue before making a pull request. Minor bug fixes can, of course, still be made directly as a pull request without raising an issue first.

For all contributions, make sure that you describe well what you plan to do / have done to speed up the evaluation / review process of your issue / pull request. The assigned member of the openMINDS development team will get back to you as soon as possible to discuss or give the blessing to your contribution. Note that, all contributing community members are welcome to provide comments on active issues and pull requests.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:  
**+** using welcoming and inclusive language  
**+** being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
**+** gracefully accepting constructive criticism

**+** showing empathy towards other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:  
**-** use of sexualized language or imagery  
**-** unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
**-** trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
**-** public or private harassment  
**-** publishing others' private information (e.g., email address) without explicit permission  
**-** other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

#### Our responsibility

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

#### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

#### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team via **`support@ebrains.eu`**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
